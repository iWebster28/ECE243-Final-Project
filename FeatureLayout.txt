____________Graphics_____________
--------Main Player----------
- Start with one main one (center); could add 2 more on left and right if time
- Fires bullets/missiles
- WASD to move cursor on scree? or mouse.
- Spacebar to fire missile

------------Enemies and Missiles----------
- Enemies - random chance of spawning?
- Missiles - Randomize - see below
- Graphics: random coloured growing circles/"explosions"

----------Missile Animation------
- Random velocities - maybe slower velocities for earlier/easier Rounds
- Maybe aim these velocities such that they will hit the player/come close to hitting the player
- Can use equation of a line (be aware that +y is down, -y is up. screen limits...etc...)


____________Gameplay Logic____________
- Generate random missiles with random velocities/locations at top of screen, in general direction of player
- If hit player, you're "OUT"

--------Collision Detection------
- Need to "draw" hitboxes around the player and missile. (track location of missiles as they move)
- Be checking for collions constantly - or as often as possible?

--------------Rounds----------------
- Certain number of missiles fired at the player per round? Or timed rounds?

--------Scoring System and Reset-----
- Increment score when hit an enemy


___________Audio______________

---------Sound Effects-----------
- On Collision
- Start, Next round, Game Over
